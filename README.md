# ReCell
ReCell is a company that specializes in the reselling of used phones. The company wanted to determine the future price of used phones, and the factors that significantly influence it. A linear regression model was used in order to determine the projected price of used phones. One-Hot encoding was used for categorical values. Log transformation was used to correct distribution plots. Outliers were converted to 1.5x the third and first quartiles according to side of whiskers. A linear regression model was made with statsmodels.api. Dealt with multicollinearity using variance inflation factors(VIF).  Deleted unnecessary variables determined through the p-value. Tested for linearity, independence, and normality.  Determined homoscedasticity through the goldfeldquandt test.
